/*

given n nodes and m edges and type of the graph
m lines / rows to represent the connection b/w the edges

There are two ways to store the grah
 matrix way and the list way


 Adjecancy matrix
    1
    / \
   2   3
    \ / \
     4---5
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 4
3 5
4 5

Steps to store the given matrix inn adj. matrix
->Declare the matrix of sixe n+1,n+1 or n,n based on its indexing , 0/1.

Space requires is N x N that is N^2 space

---------using lists------------


analogy of types of graphs

Time complexity and space complexity of stroring the grapgh in array and arraylist
