Types of graph
->Directed and undirected graph
->Nodes /vertexes
->Nodes are represented by a number, there is no specific order for numbering the nodes
->V/N represents number of nodes or vertex
->Two nodes are connected by a line which is called as edge
->Directed and undirected edge
->Undirectional edge is bidirectional
->If I am standing at 1 i can goto 4 but cannot come back from 4 to 1 that is unidirectional

->Cycles in a graph
->Grapgh can be open or close
->Start at a node and end at the same node then it is called a cyc;e in a grpah
 and that grpgh is called undirected cyclic graph
->Similaryly    directed cyclic graph
->Undirected acyclic graph and directed cyclic graph


->Path
->Degrees in a graph
The number of edges that are attached to a node are called degree of that node

Total degree of the grapgh= 2 times number of edges


Indegree and outdegree for directed graphs


Edge weight-    If weifhts are not assigned we assume it as 1.
